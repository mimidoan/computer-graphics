In order to make GPUs more efficient, you want to start with the simplest possible objects
  - Triangles are the most simple objects, instead of making a rectangle, use two Triangles
    * easiest for the GPU to render

Parametric Representation
  - utilizes parameters

  GPU
    - vertex shader, moves around the vertex and changes where it is
    - fragment shader, allows manipulation of individual pixels to render different graphics
